# Welcome to EmbeddedQues!  
A platform to share resources, discuss interview questions, collaborate on projects, and expand knowledge on embedded systems, firmware, and kernel programming.  

Join the conversation on [EmbeddedQues Discussions](https://github.com/cipherswami/EmbeddedQues/discussions)!

## Categories of discussions  
1. **General Q&A**: For open queries (Non-Interview Questions).  
   - *Example*: “What’s the role of RTOS in embedded systems?”
2. **Technical Q&A**: Share and solve technical interview questions related to embedded systems, firmware, and kernel programming.  
   - *Example*: “How is memory allocated using `calloc` and `malloc` functions?”  
3. **HR Q&A**: Share and discuss questions typically asked in HR interviews, focusing on behavioral, situational, and general interview questions.  
   - *Example*: “Tell us about a challenging project you worked on and how you handled it.”
4. **Resources**: Share tutorials, guides, tools, and learning resources for embedded systems.  
   - *Example*: “Guide to ARM Cortex-M architecture.”
5. **Suggestions**: Provide feedback, improvement ideas, or feature suggestions for EmbeddedQues.   

## Guidelines:
1. **Be respectful**: Treat all members with respect and contribute positively to the community.
2. **Be clear and concise**: Provide enough context in your questions or answers to ensure others can understand and contribute effectively.
3. **Use tags appropriately**: Help others find your post by tagging it with relevant keywords (e.g., `RTOS`, `embedded`, `microcontroller`).
